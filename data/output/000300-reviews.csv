Class is a balance of discussion and text, but tests come from the book so you must read. He sends good emails, provides handouts and I was surprised how well he ran an open, non-partisan discussion in a PS class. A fair grader. It was a fun class that opened my eyes to a lot.",,,,,False,False,[],0,0

Great teacher. He knows and cares about the subject &amp; made it interesting. Handouts each week. He uses the text for exams; grades were VERY fair. There was a 3-5 pg paper. The guest speaker from the Idaho legislature was amazing! No reservations, I absolutely recommend this guy!",,,,,False,False,[],0,0

Disagree with other rating, because I thought we had good class discussions.  It was clear that some in the class weren&#39;t reading.  It is a freshman class, and he really wants you to read the materials.  Very fair and I would take this instructor again.",,,,,False,False,[],0,0

He relies on the text book and talks about the chapters you read.  Very little class participation and no hand outs.  For tests you are required to read the chapters, to include all boxes because he will pull test questions from them.  I can&#39;t recommend this instructor.  It is his first class teaching, so he may get bette",,,,,False,False,[],0,0
